# CSBrowser

CSBrowser, or the Blade Browser, was a project I built in my fourth year of university. I was very proud of it because it only took me two or three hours to build, and I was definitely the most skilled C# developer out of all my cohort. Not only that but the basis of this had already been written, as it was based on my own Balfour's Business Class Library.

There's very little code since most of the code is found within my old BBCL.
